# UPSC Civil Services
## Notes and Books Package (with NCERTs and handwritten notes) - updated monthly
### @author Utkarsh Singh

To download, you can *git clone* or download a *zip* file from the top of this page.
(If you download a zip, you'd have to update it monthly as new material is added.
On the other hand if you use with git, simply *git pull* every month.

For any new material requests, issues or corrections, please open a new **Issue** in the Issues tab.

*Note: I have included the original pdf of all material along with my own notes which I take handwritten digitally within the pdf itself.*
